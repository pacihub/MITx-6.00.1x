# EXERCISE 1
# Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

# prints 2
# prints 4
# prints 6
# prints 8
# prints 10
# prints Goodbye!

for count in range(2,11,2):
    print(count)
print('Goodbye!') 
    
# ===========================

# EXERCISE 2
# Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.
# prints Hello!
# prints 10
# prints 8
# prints 6
# prints 4
# prints 2


print('Hello!')

for count in range(10,0,-2):
    print(count)
    
# ============================

#Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, 
#if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:21, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.


suma = 0
for count in range (0, end):
    suma = suma + count
    
print(suma+end)
